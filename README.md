When activated with Sneak right click the ring imparts the buffs on the player. Once buffed the ring becomes deplated and cannot buff other players. The buffs persist through death but can be removed by Sneak right clicking on a depleated ring.	When activated with Sneak right click the ring imparts the buffs on the player.
